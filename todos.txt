done:
* how can we access operators.py??? --> separate action in the other package?
    decision: create workflows for both packages
* update/create attributes is slow because attributes are being retrieved for a single asset
  it is possible to get all attributes of a specific tpye but not for a specific domain or communitiy (whole community??)
  --> so this ends up in many 1000s of attributes
    decision: only update data quality rule attributes and no data element attributes
* add url, user and password to github secrets

open:

# todo: do we also need to parse anonymization parameters?
# todo: currently, if e.g a dqr relation is deleted in the json file the script cant handle this
# todo: relations can not be searched inside domains or communities --> whole collibra workspace is searched! --> current limit is set to 1000 entries
